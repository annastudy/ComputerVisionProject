# Import torch and NumPy


# Set the random seed for NumPy and PyTorch both to "42"
#   This allows us to share the same "random" results.


# Create a NumPy array called "arr" that contains 6 random integers between 0 (inclusive) and 5 (exclusive)


# Create a tensor "x" from the array above


# Change the dtype of x from 'int32' to 'int64'


# Reshape x into a 3x2 tensor


# Return the left-hand column of tensor x


# Without changing x, return a tensor of square values of x


# Create a tensor "y" with the same number of elements as x, that can be matrix-multiplied with x


# Find the matrix product of x and y


# Create a Simple linear model using torch.nn
# the model will take 1000 input and output 20 multi-class classification results.
# the model will have 3 hidden layers which include 200, 120, 60 respectively.



# initiate the model and printout the number of parameters
