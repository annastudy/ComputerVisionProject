# import numpy


# creating list [0,1,2,3,4] in python and print the type of your list


# cast your list into a numpy arrary and print the type of your array


# create a 3x3 array filled with zeros


# create a 2x4 array filled with ones


# create a 3x4 array filled with tens


# create a 3x2 array filled with random numbers


# create a 3x2 arrary filled with random integers


# create an 9 elements array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]


# Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (in other words, the interval including start but excluding stop)


# reshape your array (1x9) into a 3x3 matrix


# print the shape of your matrix


# print the maximum number in your matrix


# print the minimum number in your matrix


# print the mean value in your matrix


# row and column index variables
row = 0
col = 1

# retrieve the element on first row, second column


# retrieve all the elements on second column


# retrieve all the elements on first row


# retrieve all the elements on first two rows and last two columns
