# import numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and PIL's Image libs


# open image file using Image open function in pillow library


# cast the image data into numpy array


# use plt image show function to show the image


# copy picture array into a new variable so that we can adjust the RGB channel later on.


# zero out green and blue channels' value and only keep color value in Red channel.


# try to debug the pic_red variable and see what are the RGB value examples in 3 channels after zero out.


# show the result using imshow function
